                    E-learning is here to stay. As computer ownership grows
across the globe e-learning becomes increasingly viable
and accessible. Internet connection speeds are
increasing, and with that, opportunities for more
multimedia training methods arise. With the immense
improvement of mobile networks in the past few years
and the increase in telecommuting, taking all the
awesome features of e-learning on the road is a reality
with smartphones and other portable devices.
Technologies such as social media are also transforming
education constantly.
Generally speaking, learning is expensive, takes a long
time and the results can vary. E-learning has been trying
for years now to complement the way we learn to make
30
it more effective and measurable. The result now being
that there are a number of tools that help create
interactive courses, standardize the learning process
and/or inject informal elements to otherwise formal
learning processes. Several e-learning trends give us a
view to how e-learning and learning tools will be shaped
in the future:

                    Communication through Learning Management System (LMS) is essential 
                    for fostering collaboration among learners and educators. LMS provides 
                    tools for discussions, messaging, and sharing resources, creating a 
                    dynamic and interactive learning environment.LMS stands for Learning Management System and it's a
                    global term for a computer system specifically
                    developed for managing online courses, distributing
                    course materials and allowing collaboration between
                    students and teachers. A LMS will allow you to manage
                    every aspect of a course, from the registration of
                    students to the storing of test results, as well as allowing
                    you to accept assignments digitally and keep in touch
                    with your students. In essence, the LMS is the backbone
                    of most e-learning activities.
                    LMSs are built on various platforms, commonly PHP,
                    .Net or Java and they will hook up to a database such as
                    35
                    PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQL Server. There are many
                    LMSs out there, both commercial and open source.
                    In a corporate environment such a system can be used
                    to monitor staff, and keep records of appraisals and
                    training. Whether your course is run for a few learners
                    over a long period of time, or for many over a shorter
                    period, a Learning Management System makes your life
                    easier and helps your course run smoothly. A good LMS
                    will also have a reporting system so you can access
                    information that would be tricky to gather yourself.
